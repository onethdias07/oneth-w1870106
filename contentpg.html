    <p class="pa">Invented in the mid 16th century in Spain The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single, that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly.</p>
    <h3 id="his" class="sub-head2">History</h3>
    <p class="pa">The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head with rear tuning pegs; in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the tuning pegs. The early tied-on gut frets were replaced by built-on
      ivory or
      metal
      frets in the 18th century. The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and several metal or ivory frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century the fingerboard was raised slightly above the level of the
      belly
      and was extended across it to the edge of the sound hole.

      In the 19th century the guitar’s body also underwent changes that resulted in increased sonority. It became broader and shallower, with an extremely thin soundboard. Internally, the transverse bars reinforcing the soundboard were replaced by
      radial bars that fanned out below the sound hole. The neck, formerly set into a wood block, was formed into a brace, or shoe, that projected a short distance inside the body and was glued to the back; this gave extra stability against the pull
      of
      the strings.</p>
    <h3 id="fe" class="sub-head2">Features</h3>

    <p class="pa">The guitar consists of a hollow wooden body with six strings stretched over it and along a narrow neck. Guitars usually have a single, round sound hole in the body. The strings can be strummed with the fingers or plucked. Some
      guitarists use a
      plectrum (triangular piece of plastic) to sound the strings.</p>

    <h3 id="ty" class="sub-head2">Types Of Gutairs</h3>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Electric</h4>
    <p class="pa">An electric guitar is a guitar that produces sound by vibrating strings over a pickup that converts the vibrations into electrical signals. Those signals are fed into an amplifier, which projects the musical performance at a wide
      range of volumes</p>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Acoustic</h4>
    <p class="pa">An acoustic guitar is a fretted musical instrument that produces sound via vibrating strings above a hollow chamber in the guitar’s body. The vibrations carry through the air and do not require electrical amplification (although
      many acoustic guitars also function as electric guitars).</p>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Classical</h4>
    <p class="pa">The classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish guitar) is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and other styles.The materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but
      the typical shape is either modern classical guitar or that historic classical guitar similar to the early romantic guitars of France and Italy</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is a piano?</dt>
      <dd>Piano, also called pianoforte, French piano or pianoforte,
        German Klavier, a <b><em>keyboard musical instrument</em></b> having wire
        strings that sound when struck by felt-covered hammers operated
        from a keyboard.</dd><br>


      <dt>How many keys do a piano have?</dt>
      <dd>The standard modern piano contains 88 keys and
        has a compass of seven full octaves plus a few keys.</dd><br>


      <dt>Who invented the piano and when?</dt>
      <dd>Bartolomeo Cristofori is often credited with inventing
        the piano about 1709, though this has been disputed.
        Cristofori’s piano was not the first instrument using
        keyboard striking action; examples of the piano principle
        existed as early as about 1440. However, the modern piano
        design stems from Cristofori’s creation.</dd><br>

      <dt>Who are some of the greatest pianists?</dt>
      <dd>There have been many great pianists over time
        with a variety of styles. This list includes but is
        not limited to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven,
        Frédéric Chopin, Myra Hess, and Clara Schumann. One of the
        best-known pianists of the early 21st century is Mitsuko
        Uchida.</dd><br>

    <h2 class="h2-head" id="history">History of the piano</h2>
    <p class="para">The piano was founded on earlier technological
      innovations in keyboard instruments. Pipe organs have
      been used since antiquity, and as such, the development
      of pipe organs enabled instrument builders to learn about
      creating keyboard mechanisms for sounding pitches.
      The first string instruments with struck strings were the
      hammered dulcimers,[6] which were used since the Middle
      Ages in Europe. During the Middle Ages, there were several
      attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with
      struck strings.</p><br>

      <p>Drums are some historical instruments used by ancestors,which dates back over thousand years <br>
        Initially these equipments were utilised for communication and tributing as an accompaniment for dancing <br></p>
      <p>The first drums arrived in the Neolithic cultures originating from China but later spread to all of Asia.<br>
        This period also saw the creation of Bronze Dong Son Drums in Vietnam during 3000 BC. Sri Lanka and African people later discovered drums between 1000 and 500 BC </p>
      <p>Whether you love classical music or other fun music genres, the history of drums is broad and exciting to learn.<br> Drums and drum kits have gone through different evolution phases.
        Rock drummers can now access a wide range of drums for both beginners and pro players.</p>
